# Zurabi Mestiashvili
A reverse-engineered kernel replication of our friend Zura Mestiashvili (joke repo, not actual code!)


### Background
Our friend Zura is a man of very particular habits. We created this repository to transcribe those habits into code. Most of Zura's kernel code is enclosed into the `Zura.js` file.

### Contributing
If you have noticed any new Zura habits or reverse-engineered more of his kernel, feel free to make a pull request and we will be happy to review it. Keep in mind your code styling! We recommend using `Prettier` and configuring it to prioritize styling rules included in the `.eslintrc` before pushing your code to this repository.

### License

This code is governed by the Unlicense. Any Zura signature habits are a property of Zurabi Mestiashvili. This code shall not be used to create a Zura clone as one Zura is enough.
